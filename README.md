libraries used, the motivation for the project, the files in the repository with a small description of each, a summary of the results of the analysis, and necessary acknowledgements. Students should not use another student's code to complete the project, but they may use other references on the web including StackOverflow and Kaggle to complete the project.

# Motivation
In this project the online shopping data from Instacart [1] is analyzed. In particular, the users are segmented into clusters (frequent and unfrequent users) and descriptive statistics is used to answer relevant business questions such as:

1. Do frequent users order in different days than infrequent users?
2. Do frequent frequent users order at different hours in the day than infrequent users?
3. How often do frequent users place orders compared to infrequent users?

# Files
The project requires the dataset from [1]. The files cannot be distributed on github but can be obtained from [1] or [2]. The archive file is unzipped in the current directory and comprises of several csv files. The description of the data files can be obtained at [2].
